README

Directions:
1. Run Part1.py
2. Run Part2.py

Files:
Part1.py - Contains the solution for Part 1, using our own gradient descent algorithm
Part2.py - Contains the solution for Part 2, using a gradient descent algorithm from Scikit Learn package.
preProcessing.py - Contains code that normalizes and splits the data. This file does not need to be run directly.  Part1.py and Part2.py both import and run the functions needed.

Libraries:
numpy (numpy.org/)
pandas (pandas.pydata.org/)
sklearn (scikit-learn.org)
matplotlib (matplotlib.org)
preProcessing (preprocessing.py)
